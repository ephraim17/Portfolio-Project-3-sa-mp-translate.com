- If you don't know what San Andreas Multiplayer (or SA-MP for short) is, a good place to start would be to read [Why A Million People Still Play Multiplayer Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Every Month](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/15/why-a-million-people-still-play-multiplayer-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-every-month/ "Article"), an article by Richard Moss.

- However, if you do know what SA-MP is, then you know that the Russian and English speaking communities are the two largest communities on the platform. 
- Despite their colossal sizes, the Russian and English speaking communities rarely interact with each other at scale because of the language barriers.
- Because of this, the Russian players play on Russian servers and the English players play on English servers, creating a split in the community.
- SA-MP Translate's purpose is to break the language barrier in SA-MP by providing world-class translations in SA-MP in real-time.
- With the SA-MP Translate, Russian and English players can interact with each other in real time without having to know the same language.
- We believe that by breaking the language barrier in SA-MP we can create a better experience for all the players by boosting server player counts.
